# Horned Beasts

This app is developed in using React libraries with the intended purpose of informing the user about various horned animals.

This is my first React App and represents the first steps in my journey to becoming a full-stack developer.

The App will eventually be hosted on Netlify, but if you'd like to check it out yourself feel free to fork and deploy using Node Package Manager. I don't have a backend at the moment, so deployment should be straightforward.

Feedback and suggestions always welcome. :)
